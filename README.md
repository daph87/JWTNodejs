# Creating Secure, Signed JWTs for Node.js

This project is based on the [nJwt](https://github.com/jwtk/njwt) library for Node.js developers.
The aim of this project is to show how to create and test JWT token using your own signing key secret.

## Features

- [x] Create Signing keys
- [x] Save the Signing key in a .txt file
- [x] Create a JSON token using the signing key
- [x] Validate the token

## Component Libraries

This project uses the libraries needed for nJwt to work

- `"njwt": "^1.0.0"`
- `"secure-random": "^1.1.2"`

## Requirements

- npm
- Node

## Installation

Download the repository and run `npm install` inside the directory to install the dependencies.

## Usage

You will find to classes:

- `functions.js`
- `index.js`

The `index.js` file is a complete example of how to run the example to create and validate a JWT token

You will first need to create a Signing key

```js
const helper = require("./functions");
var signingKey = helper.createSigningKey();
```

Once having a singing key you could create a `JWT` token based on this. The only mandatory fields are a `JSON` **claims** object.

```js
var claims = {
  iss: "http://myapp.com/", // The URL of your service
  sub: "users/user1234", // The UID of the user in your system
  scope: "self, admins",
  aud: "app-id", // Your APP ID,
  user_data: {
    // Metadata optional. For detailed instructions on how to set it in the UI, click here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#metadata-fields
    name: "josman",
    email: "test@test.com",
  },
};
```

Other optional fields are the algorithm used to encode the token (by default is `HS256`, the **expiration** date which is **1 hour** by default). You could find more about the parameters in the documentation of the method.

```js
var jwt = helper.createToken(claims, signingKey);
```

To verify the token you could run this function

```js
nJwt.verify(jwt, signingKey, function (err, verifiedJwt) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err); // Token has expired, has been tampered with, etc
  } else {
    console.log(verifiedJwt); // Will contain the header and body
  }
});
```

## Considerations

- If you want to create several `JWT` tokens to validate against a `Signing Key`, use the same signing key to create the tokens.
